# Form Builder - Wordpress Plugin

I built this plugin because none of the ones I found on wordpress suited my very simple need, create a **popup** multi-part form.

## Introduction

I mainly created this plugin to get the **popop multi-part** form system work together. If you find bugs or possible ameliorations (especially design-wise), don't hesitate to improve my code and share it again.


## Installation and Usage

Simply download the zip file and install it as a plugin in wordpress.
